        "ExtractionPrompt": "<think>\nAlright, I need to extract the required details from this document and present them in JSON format. Let's go through each section carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the Event Name. The event mentioned is \"Afternoon of day one\" but that doesn't seem specific enough. However, there's another part where it says \"Live at the HP Booth!\" which I think refers to the exhibit or demonstration at the show. So maybe \"HP PageWide Show and Demonstration\" would be a better Event Name.\n\nNext, Location is straightforward\u2014it\u2019s the HP Booth, so I'll note that down.\n\nFor Date, I see two dates: one under Publish Date as October 31, 2022 (but wait, that's after the event date mentioned as October 26, 2002). That might be a mistake. The event itself is on October 26, 2002, so I'll go with that.\n\nThe Publish Date is given as 31-Oct-22, which seems to be after the event's publication date in October 2022, but maybe it's for when the document was published online. So both dates are included.\n\nHP Press Model is clearly stated: A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling.\n\nPrint Mode is Performance HDK as specified in the document.\n\nType of Print Application is Commercial since it's mentioned under Media Weight Class and other commercial-related details.\n\nAverage Ink Coverage Class is Heavy (35-50%), which I'll extract directly.\n\nThe ICC Profiles used are HPICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish), so that's next.\n\nPost Coat Applied is indicated as \"Yes,\" since it says \"Post Coat Applied.\"\n\nDelivered to is Print Show Samples, so I'll include that.\n\nTension via Formula is mentioned as 40lbs Opt is OFF. Wait, the exact wording is \"Opt is OFF, tension is 40lbs.\" So Tension would be 40lbs and Optimization (Opt) is Off.\n\nMedia Star is specified as PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss with specific specs: 266 gsm-180lb-9.2ptText and Moisturizer On.\n\nMedia Weight Class is Heavy, so that's clear.\n\nShort Description of Job includes WOW 2 Sample Letter images, but I need to make sure it doesn't include any unnecessary info like \"Moisturizer Comments if any\" or the optimizer settings which mention Opt is OFF. So just \"WOW 2 Sample Letter images.\"\n\nFinally, there are some details about Media #539 and other related information which don't fit into the required fields, so I'll ignore those.\n\nPutting it all together in JSON format, making sure each key corresponds correctly to the extracted data.\n</think>\n\nHere is the extracted information in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Event Name\": \"HP PageWide Show and Demonstration\",\n  \"Location\": \"HP Booth\",\n  \"Date\": \"October 26, 2002\",\n  \"Publish Date\": \"31-Oct-22\",\n  \"HP Press Model\": \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling\",\n  \"Print Mode\": \"Performance HDK\",\n  \"Type of Print Application\": \"Commercial\",\n  \"Average Ink Coverage Class\": \"Heavy (35-50%)\",\n  \"ICC Profiles used in this print run\": \"HPICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish)\",\n  \"Post Coat Applied\": true,\n  \"Delivered to\": \"Print Show Samples\",\n  \"Tension via Formula\": {\n    \"Tension\": \"40lbs\",\n    \"Optimization Off\": true\n  },\n  \"Media Star For This Print Run\": {\n    \"Type\": \"INKJET COATED GLOSS\",\n    \"Coated Media Weight\": \"180lb-9.2ptText\",\n    \"Moisturizer\": true,\n    \"Weight Class\": \"Heavy\"\n  },\n  \"Short Description of Job\": \"WOW 2 Sample Letter images\"\n}\n```",
        "DetailedJsonStructure": "<think>\nOkay, I need to extract structured data from this JSON-formatted text. The user provided a specific structure to follow with nested sections like EventDetails, MediaSpecifications, and Additional. Let me go through the content step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the event details: it's \"Afternoon of day one\" on October 26, 2002. So I'll set EventName to that, Date as October 26, 2002, Location is probably HP Booth!, and PublishDate should be November 31, 2022.\n\nNext for MediaSpecifications: Model is A 2200 with 3 dryer zones, active cooling. Print mode is Performance HDK, type is commercial inkjet. Average coverage is Heavy, so that's the value. ICC profiles used are HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish). Post coat applied isn't mentioned, so maybe leave as \"Not Mentioned.\" Media weight class is Heavy.\n\nIn Additional, there's a list of images and comments. I'll list the images as Learning Sys Filename: PWP at the Show Prints On Heavy Media Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9. The comments include contact info from HP Inc., so I'll note that.\n\nI should make sure all fields are filled correctly and any missing information is marked as \"Not Mentioned.\" Also, ensure dates are in the specified format.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s the structured data extracted and organized according to your requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"EventDetails\": {\n        \"EventName\": \"Afternoon of day one\",\n        \"Location\": \"HP Booth!\",\n        \"Date\": \"October 26, 2002\",\n        \"PublishDate\": \"31-Oct-22\"\n    },\n    \"MediaSpecifications\": {\n        \"MediaName\": \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling\",\n        \"MediaType\": \"Inkjet\",\n        \"MediaWeight\": \"Heavy\",\n        \"Certifications\": [\n            \"FSC\",\n            \"PEFC\",\n            \"SFI\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"Additional\": {\n        \"Images\": [\n            \"Learning Sys Filename: PWP at the Show Prints On Heavy Media Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9\"\n        ],\n        \"Comments\": [\"Contact: Themediamaster@hp.com\", \"HP Inc.

        "RoleSpecificPrompt": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this query where someone wants me to extract key structured details from a report and present them in JSON format. The user mentioned it's for system automation, so they probably need these details organized neatly for processing or integration into another system.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully to identify relevant sections. It starts with some event details on the afternoon of day one at the show. The main event is about an HP PageWide Advantage 2200 press that's configured with three dryer zones and active web cooling running live. That seems important for grouping the event details.\n\nNext, there are mentions of press-related parameters like model, ink type, settings, and media specifics. I need to extract each of these systematically. The model is \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling,\" which should be under Press Model. The ink is \"HP Brilliant Ink\" for the HP PageWide Media News section.\n\nLooking at the settings, the print mode is Performance HDK in Commercial application with Heavy Ink Coverage (35-50%). ICC profiles used are HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish), and there's a post coat applied. The media details include specifics like pixelle speciality solutions with their superior glossy inkjet coated paper, which is 266 gsm-180lb-9.2ptText. Moisturizer on, heavy media class.\n\nThe short description mentions \"WOW 2 Sample Letter images,\" and there's a note about optimizer via process and brilliant inks. The tension settings are Opt off at 40lbs. There's also an optimization comment regarding the press settings not being optimal (Opt is OFF) with Tension 40lbs.\n\nUnder media details, there's info on availability regions: North America; Europe Middle East Africa; Asia Pacific Japan; Latin America. Environmental certifications like FSC, PEFC, SFI are present. The results section talks about compatibility and inviting users to test their jobs on similar media, with a note about the print speed range.\n\nI'll structure this into groups as per the user's request: Group 1 for event details (name, location, date), Group 2 for press-related parameters, and Group 3 for media details. Each section will have sub-keys like Media, Model, Print Mode, etc.\n\nWait, I need to make sure all the parameters are captured accurately. For the press settings, it's Performance HDK as the mode, Heavy Ink Coverage as the class. Media specifics include pixelle's product and its attributes. The dryer zones and cooling active mention should go under dryer settings range? Or perhaps under dryer settings.\n\nThe media weight class is heavy, so I'll note that. Moisturizer on is a parameter to include. ICC profiles used are part of the print mode or separate?\n\nI think it's better to list each specific parameter clearly under their respective headings. The post coat applied should be included as another parameter.\n\nLooking at the sample media number and public info, Media #539 and Public from Pixelle, that goes under media details along with availability regions and certifications.\n\nPrint speed range is given, so I'll include that in print speeds. The optimizer note regarding process might go under optimized notes or something similar.\n\nI also see there's a contact email for sample files, which should be part of the media details as well.\n\nThe results section mentions the speed range (450-500'/min), so that goes into print speed range. The press recipe for success is about testing similar jobs on this media, so that might go under media compatibility or something else.\n\nI think I've covered all the key points. Now, organizing them into JSON with appropriate sub-keys and making sure there are no typos or formatting issues.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured data extracted from the report in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Group 1\": {\n    \"Event Details\": {\n      \"Name\": \"HP PageWide continues to show the Advantage 2200 Press\",\n      \"Location\": \"Show location\",\n      \"Date\": \"October 26, 2002\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Group 2\": {\n    \"Press Related Parameters\": {\n      \"Model\": \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling\",\n      \"Ink Type\": \"HP Brilliant Ink\",\n      \"Print Mode\": \"Performance HDK\",\n      \"Print Application\": \"Commercial\",\n      \"Average Ink Coverage Class\": \"Heavy Ink Coverage (35-50%)\",\n      \"Post Coat Applied\": \"Yes\",\n      \"Media Used\": {\n        \"Description\": \"Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9.2ptText\",\n        \"Moisturizer\": \"On\"\n      },\n      \"Dryer Settings Range\": \"260-280 Deg F\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Group 3\": {\n    \"Media Details\": {\n      \"Media Type\": \"Heavy Media Class\",\n      \"Print Speed Range\": \"450-500'/min\",\n      \" ICC Profiles Used\": \"HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish)\",\n      \"Post Coat Applied\": \"Yes\",\n      \"Moisturizer\": \"On\"\n    },\n    \"Media Compatibility\": {\n      \"Results\": \"Representing the compatibility of the Press, Ink, Media, and related press settings to produce successful samples on HP Presses.\"\n    },\n    \"Public Information\": {\n      \"Availability Regions\": \"North America; Europe Middle East Africa; Asia Pacific Japan; Latin America\",\n      \"Environmental Certifications\": [\"FSC\", \"PEFC\", \"SFI\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
        "ErrorHandlingPrompt": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this query where someone is asking me to extract details from a text and include an errors section for missing or ambiguous data. The structure they want is under two main sections: Event Details and Media Specs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the input text thoroughly. It's about an event at the Printing United Expo Show in Las Vegas on October 26, 2002. They mention HP PageWide Advantage 2200 press with specific configurations like three dryer zones and active web cooling. The media used is from Pixelle, a coated gloss paper with certain specifications.\n\nLooking at the Event Details section, I can extract the event name, which is the HP PageWide press setup. The location is Las Vegas, NV, and the date is October 26, 2002. The publish date given is November 31, 2022, but that seems off because the show was in 2002. I should note this discrepancy.\n\nFor Media Specs, they list the media type as coated gloss, with specific weight and size classes (Heavy). The press model is A2200 with three dryers and active cooling. Print mode is Performance HDK for commercial use. They mention ICC profiles used, post-coat application, and that it was delivered to samples via formula tension.\n\nI also notice some details are missing or unclear. For example, the Exact Model Number isn't clear\u2014it's just listed as A2200 with three dryers. The exact print mode might be too specific without context. The media weight class is Heavy, but without more info on why that's important.\n\nThere's mention of an optimizer via process and a recipe for success, which are good points but could use more specifics. Also, the press settings like temperature range (260-280\u00b0F) aren't detailed enough, just mentioned as a general setting.\n\nI should make sure to highlight these missing or unclear parts in an errors section so the user knows where improvements can be made. Maybe also suggest standardizing some terms and providing more context for clarity.\n</think>\n\n### Event Details  \n**Event Name:** HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press Setup and Demonstration  \n**Location:** Las Vegas, NV  \n**Date:** October 26, 2002 (Show date)  \n**Publish Date:** November 31, 2022  \n\n---\n\n### Media Specs  \n**Media Name:** Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss  \n**Media Weight Class:** Heavy  \n**Print Mode:** Performance HDK  \n**Type of Print Application:** Commercial  \n**Average Ink Coverage Class:** Heavy (35-50%)  \n**ICC Profiles Used:** HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish)  \n**Post Coat Applied:** Yes  \n**Delivered to:** Print Show Samples  \n**Tension via Formula:** Yes  \n\n---\n\n### Errors Section for Missing or Ambiguous Data:  \n1. **Missing Media Weight Class Details:** The media weight class is mentioned as \"Heavy\" but lacks additional details about the specific weight, size, or purpose of this weight class in relation to the print run.  \n2. **Ambiguous Print Mode:** The print mode is listed as \"Performance HDK,\" but it would be helpful to know more about how this setting specifically contributed to the print quality or performance during the event.\n3. **Unclear Exact Model Number:** While the press model is described as an \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling,\" there is no exact model number provided, which could help in replicating or referencing the setup.\n4. **Limited Details on Post Coat Application:** The post coat applied was mentioned but lacks specifics about its type or application method during the print run.  \n5. **Ambiguous Moisturizer Comments:** Moisturizer comments are not explicitly mentioned, and if they were used, their specific settings would need to be detailed for clarity.  \n6. **Printing Temperature Range:** The exact printing temperature range (260-280\u00b0F) is mentioned but lacks additional context about why this specific range was chosen or how it affected the print quality.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured extraction helps organize the information, while identifying areas where more details could be provided for clarity and completeness."
