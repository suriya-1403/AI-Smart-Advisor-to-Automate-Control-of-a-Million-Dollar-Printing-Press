        "ExtractionPrompt": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to extract specific details from this document and put them into JSON format. The user has given me a list of fields they want: Event Name, Location, Date, Publish Date, HP Press Model, Print Mode, and Type of Print Application. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text to find each piece of information one by one. \n\nStarting with the Event Name: The document mentions \"Afternoon of day one\" but that doesn't seem specific enough for an event name. Then it talks about the HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press being shown. Maybe the event is called something like \"HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press Show Presentation.\"\n\nNext, Location: The text says it's live at the HP Booth! and mentions the location as \"Live at the HP Location,\" but that's vague. It also states it's part of the Printing United Expo Show in Las Vegas, NV. So I think the location should be set to \"N/A\" since it doesn't provide a specific place beyond the booth.\n\nDate: There are two dates mentioned. One is Wednesday October 26, 2002, which seems more relevant because that's when the publish date falls. The publish date is given as 31-Oct-22, but wait, that might be a typo or placeholder since it's followed by \"Rev.B\" and an email address. I'll stick with October 26, 2002 for the event date.\n\nPublish Date: Definitely, that's the one in bold: 31-Oct-22. But considering the context, maybe they meant November? Wait, no, it says 31-Oct-22, but then there\u2019s an email at the end mentioning F3A22001019Rev.B which could be a revision number or version code for October. I'll keep it as October 31, 2022.\n\nHP Press Model: Looking through the text, I see \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling\" mentioned in the media details section. So that's probably the model.\n\nPrint Mode: The term is listed as Performance HDK. I'll take that as Print Mode.\n\nType of Print Application: It says it's Commercial. That should be straightforward.\n\nWait, let me double-check if I missed anything else. The text also mentions Media Weight Class: Heavy and ICC Profiles used, but those aren't part of the required fields. Similarly, other details like print speed range or comments are not needed here. So sticking to the main fields as per the user's request.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary information. Now I can structure this into a JSON format with each field correctly assigned.\n</think>\n\nHere is the extracted information formatted in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Event Name\": \"HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press Show Presentation\",\n  \"Location\": \"N/A\",\n  \"Date\": \"October 26, 2002\",\n  \"Publish Date\": \"31-Oct-22\",\n  \"HP Press Model\": \"A 2200 3 Dryer Press w/Active Cooling\",\n  \"Print Mode\": \"Performance HDK\",\n  \"Type of Print Application\": \"Commercial\"\n}\n```",
        "DetailedJsonStructure": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this user query where they want me to extract structured data from a nested JSON format based on the given schema. The text provided is quite detailed and includes a lot of technical specifications about an HP printing press event.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure they provided. It has three main sections: EventDetails, MediaSpecifications, and Additional. Each section contains specific fields that I should look for in the text.\n\nStarting with \"EventDetails\", I see fields like EventName, Location, Date, and PublishDate. Scanning through the text, I can find the event name is \"HP PageWide continues to show the Advantage 2200 Press\". The location is mentioned as \"Live at the HP Booth!\", but since that's more of a booth location than an event venue, maybe I should consider if there's another physical location specified. However, it doesn't seem so, so perhaps EventName can include both.\n\nThe Date part says \"Afternoon of day one:...\" and then later mentions October 26, 2002 as the Publish Date. So the date would be that publication date. For Location, since it's an event at a show, maybe just note Las Vegas, NV? But in the text, it's mentioned as \"Live at the HP Booth!\", so perhaps that suffices.\n\nMoving on to MediaSpecifications, there are fields like MediaName, MediaType, MediaWeight, and Certifications. The media name is given as \"Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9\". That should go under MediaName. MediaWeight is listed as Heavy, so that's straightforward.\n\nCertifications are mentioned later: FSC, PEFC, SFI. These are environmental standards, so they fit into the Certifications array.\n\nNext, Additional includes Images and Comments. In the text, there are mentions of images like \"WOW 2 Sample Letter images\" and \"Media # 539\". Also, there's a note about Moisturizer Comments but it doesn't specify any issues, so maybe that's empty for now. The media star is described with some technical details, which can be part of the Additional Images if needed.\n\nI also notice some specific details under \"Additional\" like Print Speed Range and other process information, which might need to be categorized correctly. However, based on the schema provided, these aren't included in the Additional section, so maybe they should go elsewhere or perhaps not at all unless specified.\n\nThe user didn't mention handling images beyond the first two, but there are several image descriptions (Printed Images below: Learning Sys Filename... and another one), so those can be added as images under AdditionalImages array.\n\nI need to make sure that dates are correctly formatted. The PublishDate is October 31, 2002, which I should format properly in the JSON output.\n\nAlso, checking for any special characters or formatting issues. For example, there's a mention of HP Inc. All Rights Reserved, but unless it needs to be included elsewhere, maybe it's not necessary here.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll extract each piece of information into their respective fields and structure them in JSON as per the user's schema. I should ensure that dates are formatted correctly with the appropriate separators, using double quotes for strings, and commas properly between objects without trailing commas which could cause syntax errors.\n</think>\n\nHere is the structured data extracted from the nested JSON format based on the provided schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"EventDetails\": {\n        \"EventName\": \"HP PageWide continues to show the Advantage 2200 Press\",\n        \"Location\": \"Live at the HP Booth!\",\n        \"Date\": \"Wednesday October 26, 2002\",\n        \"PublishDate\": \"31-Oct-22\"\n    },\n    \"MediaSpecifications\": {\n        \"MediaName\": \"Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9\",\n        \"MediaType\": \"Coated Gloss\",\n        \"MediaWeight\": \"Heavy\",\n        \"Certifications\": [\"FSC\", \"PEFC\", \"SFI\"]\n    },\n    \"Additional\": {\n        \"Images\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageResource\",\n                \"filename\": \"Learning Sys Filename: PWP at the Show Prints On Heavy Media Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageResource\",\n                \"filename\": \"Printed Images below: Learning Sys Filename: PWP at the Show Prints On Heavy Media Pixelle Speciality Solutions PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss 266 gsm-180lb-9\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"Comments\": []\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis structure captures the key details from the provided text, grouping them logically according to the schema you provided.",
        "RoleSpecificPrompt": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to process this report for system automation by extracting key structured details in JSON format. The user wants two main groups: event details and press-related parameters.\n\nFirst, the event details should include name, location, and date. Looking at the text, it's about an HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press. It was shown at the Printing United Expo Show in Las Vegas, NV on October 26, 2002. So I'll note those as Event Name: \"HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press\", Location: \"Las Vegas, NV\", and Date: \"October 26, 2002\".\n\nNext are the press-related parameters. The model is A 2200 with 3 dryer zones and active web cooling. The print mode used was Performance HDK for a commercial job in heavy ink coverage (35-50%). ICC profiles were HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100, post-coat applied, delivered to samples, and tension via formula.\n\nFor the media details, it's specified as Heavy Media Weight Class with specific specs like 266 gsm-180lb-9.2ptText, moisturizer on, pixelle superior gloss, etc. Print speed is between 450-500'/min, and the print event ID is 70.\n\nOther details include dryer settings from 260-280\u00b0F, optimizer via process, brilliant ink used, and support email.

        "ErrorHandlingPrompt": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a chunk of text about an event related to HP presses and printing media. They want me to extract specific details like Event Details (Event Name, Location, Date, Publish Date) and Media Specs (Media Name, Type, Weight, Certifications). Also, there's mention of including an errors section for missing or ambiguous data.\n\nFirst, I'll need to parse the given text carefully. Let's start with the event details. The main event seems to be about HP PageWide at the Printing United Expo Show in Las Vegas, NV on October 26, 2002. So that should cover Event Name, Location, Date, and Publish Date.\n\nNext, for Media Specs, I need to identify the media name, type, weight, and certifications. The text mentions \"ColorPRO papers coated with a gloss finish\" which suggests they're using HP's Media Star: PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS. The specifications are 266 gsm-180lb-9.2ptText. As for certifications, it lists FSC, PEFC, SFI. I should note these down.\n\nNow, looking through the text again, I notice a mention of HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish) but without more details like the exact model or version. There's also an entry \"Special Setup+Tension Comments?\" where it says Opt is OFF and tension is 40lbs. That seems important to include as it adds operational specifics.\n\nThere are some other mentions, like the Media # being 539 from Mills Public, but I don't have enough context about this media. It might be a source or reference number but doesn't provide necessary details, so it's ambiguous and should go in the errors section.\n\nI also see references to ICC profiles used (HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100) which is useful, but the specifics like profile version are missing. Moisturizer application isn't mentioned anywhere except in a note that it's on for media with higher text content.\n\nIn terms of setup comments, the HP Press Model is A2200 with 3 dryer zones and active cooling. Print Mode is Performance HDK, which I should include. The print application is commercial, average ink coverage is heavy (35-50%), and ICC profiles used are as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe media's environmental certifications are FSC, PEFC, SFI, so those go under Media Type. The results section mentions sample compatibility but lacks specifics about testing procedures or exact image quality metrics, which would be helpful for users.\n\nPrint speed is given as 450-500'/min, and the dryer settings range from 260-280\u00b0F. These should be included under press specs. The media's physical characteristics like weight class are mentioned but might need more details to fit into the Media Type section.\n\nI notice that the original text mentions a lot of internal HP references which aren't directly relevant for external extraction, so those can probably be excluded unless they provide specific data points needed.\n\nPutting this all together, I'll structure the Event Details and Media Specs with clear sections. For errors, anything without specifics like model version, exact ICC profile, print mode beyond HDK (which might need clarification), media sample info beyond compatibility, and some operational details will go there.\n\nI think that covers most of it. Now, I should format this clearly so the user can easily understand each section and any missing or unclear parts.\n</think>\n\n### Event Details:\n- **Event Name**: HP PageWide Advantage 2200 Press with HP Brilliant Ink\n- **Location**: HP Booth at the Printing United Expo Show (\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af, NV)\n- **Date**: October 26, 2002\n- **Publish Date**: October 31, 2002\n\n---\n\n### Media Specs:\n- **Media Name**: PIXELLE SUPERIOR GLOSS Inkjet Coated Gloss  \n  - Weight: 266 gsm, 180 lb, 9.2 pt (Text)  \n- **Media Type**: Commercial Printing Media  \n- **Certifications**: FSC, PEFC, SFI  \n\n---\n\n### Additional Information:\n- **HP Press Model**: A2200 3 Dryer Press with Active Cooling\n- **Print Mode**: Performance HDK  \n- **Print Application**: Commercial\n- **Average Ink Coverage Class**: Heavy (35-50%)\n- **Media Weight Class**: Heavy  \n- **ICC Profiles Used**: HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100 (finish)  \n- **Post Coat Applied**: Yes  \n- **Delivered to**: Print Show Samples  \n- **Moisturizer Comments**: Moisturizer is applied for media with higher text content.  \n- **Special Setup+Tension Comments**: Opt is OFF, tension is set at 40 lbs.  \n\n---\n\n### Notes on Missing or Ambiguous Data:\n1. **HP ICC Color Profile CMYK 100**: Specific version or details are not provided.  \n2. **Print Mode Details**: Beyond \"Performance HDK,\" no further specifications (e.g., profile version) are included.  \n3. **Media Sample Information**: While the media is mentioned as being tested for compatibility, specific results or testing procedures are not detailed.  \n4. **Media # 539**: The source of this media number and its relevance to other details are unclear.  \n\n---\n\n### Media Certifications:\n- FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)  \n- PEFC (Polymatthews Environmental Criteria)  \n- SFI (Society for Forest Industries)"
